Make a call based on the skills that are most relevant for the job and based on the job description.\n<human>: Given the following passage, what is the main idea of the passage? Passage:  The first industrial revolution in Britain took place in the late 18th and early 19th century. It was based on machines powered by steam, and it led to changes in agriculture, manufacturing, and transportation. Factories were built in cities and towns, and the pace of life changed as a result. The factory system led to the development of the first effective labor unions, which improved working conditions. The development of the steam engine, and later the internal combustion engine, also led to an increase in the use of fossil fuels and pollution. The second industrial revolution began in the late 19th century. It was based on the use of electricity and mass production techniques, and it led to more efficient factories, mass transit systems, and the use of petroleum and natural gas. Factories became larger and cities grew even faster, leading to crowded conditions and social problems. There were also major advances in medicine and public health, and life expectancies in many countries increased. The third industrial revolution began in the late 20th century. It was based on computers and information technology, and it led to the development of the Internet and the World Wide Web. Computers became faster and more powerful, and they could be used in almost any situation. In the next few years, they are likely to be used to control many aspects of our lives.\n<bot>: The first industrial revolution in Britain took place in the late 18th and early 19th century, and it led to changes in agriculture, manufacturing, and transportation.
